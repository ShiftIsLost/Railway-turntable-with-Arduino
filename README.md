# Railway turntable with Arduino

This is a simple Arduino project made for home hobbyist. It's a Arduino Nano (will also work with most other Arduinos) connected to a stepper driver which drives a stepper moter. There is also an analog keyboard for which is used to remember stepper positions and 2 digital buttons for manual driving and setting stepper motor positions.

## Components

The project contains the next list of components:

- Arduino Nano  
- Analog keypad 3x4 
  - 12x buttons
  - 3x 1.5k Ohm resistor
